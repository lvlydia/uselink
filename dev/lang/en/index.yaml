As these nodes use decentralized consensus to certain extent to maintain decentralized distributed ledger, other users can enjoy the service of entire blockchain network. Uselink will select 101 super nodes, which is 5 time more than EOS, to ensure a better stability of entire network.

  performance: Performance and advantages
  perfor-info: The Uselink chain supports original multi-asset, and new chain tokens can be issued without a contract. Compared with the contract assets, the native multi-assets do not need to perform complex calculations in the virtual machine, and do not need to initialize the operating environment of the virtual machine, which optimizes the performance. At the same time, users will not have the access to operations other than assets, even if the user's computer skills are low, they can still safely use the original assets for transactions.
