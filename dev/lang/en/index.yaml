  title1: Innovative Mechanism  Leading Performance
  delegateName: Super-node
  delegate-info: Uselink uses the same DPOS solution as EOS network, which greatly resolve the issue of delay and low throughput. As these nodes use decentralized consensus to certain extent to maintain decentralized distributed ledger, other users can enjoy the service of entire blockchain network. Uselink will select 101 super nodes, which is 5 time more than EOS, to ensure a better stability of entire network.

  voted: Division of voting and mining
  vote-onfo: Other users can have an impact on the replacement of super nodes by voting to super nodes. After receiving block producing reward, selected super node will reward the voter by giving profit distribution, which can make entire community more united and prospers.

  performance: Performance and advantages
  perfor-info: The Uselink chain supports original multi-asset, and new chain tokens can be issued without a contract. Compared with the contract assets, the native multi-assets do not need to perform complex calculations in the virtual machine, and do not need to initialize the operating environment of the virtual machine, which optimizes the performance. At the same time, users will not have the access to operations other than assets, even if the user's computer skills are low, they can still safely use the original assets for transactions.
